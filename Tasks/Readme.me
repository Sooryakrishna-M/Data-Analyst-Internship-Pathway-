I have used the  "Mall Customer Segmentation Data" as the dataset mentioned in the instructions. 
It was in 200 * 5 format and in csv format.
Firstly I imported Pandas library.
Then read the files using pd.read_csv() funtion.
After that, deleted all duplicated using -df.drop_duplicates() function.
There onwards used - df.isnull() , df.isnull().sum() function for finding the null values which was zero in this case.
All other instructions was satisfied with the dataset.
Thus the Task1 was satisfied.
