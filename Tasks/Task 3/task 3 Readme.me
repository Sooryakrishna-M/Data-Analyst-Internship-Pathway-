# Task 3: SQL for Data Analysis 🧠📊

This task is part of my Data Analyst Internship Pathway. It focuses on using SQL to analyze and extract insights from structured data — specifically, an Ecommerce Shipping dataset.

## 📁 Dataset Used
**Ecommerce Shipping Data.db.csv**  
This dataset includes customer orders, product costs, shipping modes, delivery status, and more.

### 📌 Columns:
- `Mode_of_Shipment`
- `Customer_care_calls`
- `Customer_rating`
- `Cost_of_the_Product`
- `Prior_purchases`
- `Product_importance`
- `Gender`
- `Discount_offered`
- `Weight_in_gms`
- `Reached.on.Time_Y.N`

---

## 🔧 Tools Used
- **SQLite** (via VSCode SQLite plugin)
- **VSCode**
- **SQL (Structured Query Language)**

---

## 🧪 SQL Concepts Applied
- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`
- Aggregate functions: `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `SUM()`
- Subqueries
- Views (`CREATE VIEW`)
- Joins (not applicable in this dataset but included as learning)
- Indexing (for query optimization, if needed)

---

## 📊 Key Queries
- Average cost by shipping mode
- Total orders by gender
- Late vs. on-time delivery counts
- Average customer rating by product importance
- Products with above-average discounts
- **View**: Summary of shipments by mode

---

## 📸 Screenshots
All output screenshots are available in the `screenshots/` folder.  
Each image corresponds to the result of a specific query mentioned above.

---

## 📄 Deliverables
- `task3_queries.sql`: All SQL queries written and tested
- `README.md`: This file
- `Ecommerce Shipping Data.db.csv`: Original dataset
- `screenshots/`: Folder containing query results

---

## 🎯 Outcome
Through this task, I gained hands-on experience in querying structured datasets using SQL. It helped reinforce my understanding of core SQL operations, aggregations, and data summarization techniques.
